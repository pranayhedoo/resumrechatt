A = 5 
B = 3
# print(A+B)
# print(A-B)
# print(A*B)
# print(A%B)

#  Camparision Operator   outpur is booleab values

# print(A > B)
# print(A < B)
# print(A == B)
# print(A != B)   # Not equalto

# Logical operator

# print(A>10 and B<10)    # Rule Both true are true others are false
# print(A==5 or B==3)      # both false are false others are true
